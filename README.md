# 🛠️ About RialOverse: Profile Builder v.1

RialOverse is a project I created for the Rialo community, allowing you to personalize your own character. I built this first version of RialOverse as a web-based profile builder. In it, you can:
* Build a character from scratch with many elements: backgrounds, skins, noses, mouths, tattoos, eyes, eyebrows, clothing, hands, faces, hair, offhands, heads, and accessories
* Assemble a random character by clicking the shuffle button
* Download your created character for use in personal projects, social media profiles, or simply as a digital collection.

## 🧪 Rare Item !
"If you're a Developer, or you can find! you'll find it and unlock the secret of rare items!"
This isn't just a gimmick. There's a hidden secret for those looking for Rare Items. I've listed rare item info on the information board.

## 🔮 What's Next?
I envision RialOverse evolving into something new—perhaps a game, an interactive world, or even integration with blockchain technology or AI. But most importantly, I want RialOverse to be a place for play and expression.
Thank you for trying out and supporting this project.

Rethink, Rebuild, Rialo.
